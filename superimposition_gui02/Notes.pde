Make Additional lines per rhythm that cover part of the rhythm line for the pitch
normalize, and then figure a way to plug values into the line and rect functions
range width, tessatura, use the center of the line and draw the range, constrain to make sure it doesn't go above/below the track
1-10 for the tessatura
line at top underneath everything for pitch class


Pitch Class Method
  Swaths of transparent color
  Catagories - algorithms - Make by staff so each staff will have a characteristic
    Range width
    Tessatura
    Direction
    Chord Change

Make a all pitch with different densities of chord change
Make several small range width that jump around with different tessatura
Going up and down linearly

For this piece:
2 messiaen modes
A 12 tone row
0124? tetrachord
open pitch

DYNAMICS
  Hairpins - amount, density
  General Dynamic & frequency of changes
  
ARTICULATIONS

FORM 5MIN(MAIN, DENSE) - 2MIN(SPARCE) - 3MIN(MAIN,DENSE) - 2MIN(LOTS OF ELECTRONICS) - 2MIN(MAIN,DENSE)



Sustained Notes
Pauses In The Action
Articulations
Pitch/PitchSet/Dynamic Worm


Make a tup3 function - triple nested tuplets
Make 30 tuplets
Make 20 rhythm sets

Make 10 algorithms to run on all 50 sets
1,1,2,3,5,8,13
1,2,3,2,1
1,2,1,5,1,7,3
7,3,2,7
9,1,1,3,1,2,5,1,7
2,3,1
5,3,7
1,3
2,2,4,6,6,8
3,3,5,5,1,7,7

Draw a thickish line like cage aria for tessitura/dynamics/pitchset

sustained notes

choose a few articulations each
tongueslap, trill, fluttertongue, multiphonics
bartok pizz, mute, trill, ??

way to display live electronics; live electronics will be chosen at random?
way of introducing space

Way of randomly choosing rhythms and flagging the ones I like

Make tuplets & rhythm sets in processing
Make rhythms (extracted from rhythm sets) in sc


All algorhythms triggered from supercollier side
Build rhythm trees within processing
Have sets of possibilities in supercollider
Trigger in Processing - @start+10px and half+2beats

I control live:
  Pitch Set Changes
  Effects
  Sample Triggers
  Possibly which sets of notation and how quickly it goes through


Simplify so only a drawing program


Make it so it updates first half 3/4 of the way and 2nd half 1/4 of the way

//make sets of tuplets
//way of arranging which partials to display
//algorthim of choosing various tuplets and partials
//arrays of x values
// random choosing of the array with beat range 
//find min and max partials, then random for those partials
//classify, oscify

//make a bunch of tuplets
//function to grab tuplet, give range and algorithm, and store in array
//trigger to draw
