Sustained Notes
Pauses In The Action
Articulations
Pitch/PitchSet/Dynamic Worm



Make a tup3 function - triple nested tuplets
Make 30 tuplets
Make 20 rhythm sets

Make 10 algorithms to run on all 50 sets
1,1,2,3,5,8,13
1,2,3,2,1
1,2,1,5,1,7,3
7,3,2,7
9,1,1,3,1,2,5,1,7
2,3,1
5,3,7
1,3
2,2,4,6,6,8
3,3,5,5,1,7,7

Draw a thickish line like cage aria for tessitura/dynamics/pitchset

sustained notes

choose a few articulations each
tongueslap, trill, fluttertongue, multiphonics
bartok pizz, mute, trill, ??

way to display live electronics; live electronics will be chosen at random?
way of introducing space

Way of randomly choosing rhythms and flagging the ones I like

Make tuplets & rhythm sets in processing
Make rhythms (extracted from rhythm sets) in sc


All algorhythms triggered from supercollier side
Build rhythm trees within processing
Have sets of possibilities in supercollider
Trigger in Processing - @start+10px and half+2beats

I control live:
  Pitch Set Changes
  Effects
  Sample Triggers
  Possibly which sets of notation and how quickly it goes through


Simplify so only a drawing program


Make it so it updates first half 3/4 of the way and 2nd half 1/4 of the way
